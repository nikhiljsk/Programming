Static:Memory allocation is not possible
Dynamic:Memory allocation and deallocation is 
not possible

allocating the memory to a pointer which already contains an address of a variable is called memory leak

dangling pointer :pointer which contains the address of deallocated memory        
---after deallocating the memory assign the pointer with NULL value so as to resolve the dangling pointer
