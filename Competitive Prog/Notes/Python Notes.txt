IDLE --Integrated development env.
Python consits of 3 interfaces
1...Interactive(GUI)
	interprets line by line and gives results after every line
2...Developer(GUI)
	interprets line by line and gives results after the interpretation of the entire
	file
3...Command line interface(CLI)
	similar to interactive but designed for terminal

Python is case sensitive
Python has key words
No declaration in python ex.int a;

Every data type is in terms of class
a=5;
type(a) === class 'int'
One variable can be used to overwrite with different types of data type

????slack memory?---

assignment of multiple variables is possible....
ex-- 1...a=b=c
     2...a,b,c=5,5.12,"hello"
     3...a,b=b,a	#swapping variables in one go

local variable > global variable 	#interms of priority
to make a varible global just use the keyword "global" before the initialization of a variable even if the variable initialization
is in the function---first declare the variable with global keyword and then initialize it.

Python data types
Lists
Tuple
Dictionaries


Mutable objects---whose value is changeable similarly immutable
Strings---Immutable----a="string'	#the interpreter return an error

Positive and negative index are there in arrays also the strings are stored in the form of array of characters

Logical operators---- and , or ,not -------not (x>10 and y>10)
Arithematic -----x**y---x to the power of y
bitwise--------x>>y (Shifts the bits of x y steps to the varialbee x to the right)

Conditional statements

if (x>y) :
	statement 1;
	statement 2;
elif (y>x) :
	statement 3;
else:
	statement 4;

Loops:
for i in range(1,5)---1,2,3,4
for i in range(5)---0,1,2,3,4
for i in range(1,7,2)----1,3,5--------(starting,ending,Step value[increamenting])
